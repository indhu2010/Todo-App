## Description :
The project is a simple Todo List application built using React. Here's how it works:

The user can add new todo items by typing into the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add Todo" button.
Each todo item consists of a title and a completion status.
The user can mark todo items as completed by clicking on a checkmark icon next to each item. Once completed, the item's title is displayed with a strikethrough style.
The user can delete todo items by clicking on a trash icon next to each item. A confirmation dialog is displayed before deleting the item.
Todo items are persisted locally using the localStorage API, so they remain available even after the user closes the browser window.
Overall, the project provides a basic implementation of a todo list application using React, with features for adding, completing, and deleting todo items, along with localStorage for data persistence.
